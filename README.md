# Hi! I'm Sole (Soledad Galli) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lead data scientist, book author, machine learning instructor and open source developer. âœ¨

I started working as a data scientist in 2015, and since then, I came a long way. I've worked in finance and insurance 
companies, and then in an energy start-up. In 2017, I created and launched my first online course on feature engineering
for machine learning. I created this course because I saw a gap in the available resources on the topic at that
time. Since then, I've created more courses on machine learning and also an open-source Python package for feature 
engineering: [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine). ðŸš€

I am passionate about learning and teaching topics related to data science, machine learning and AI software 
engineering in Python. 

I'm currently dedicating to expanding [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) and to 
creating new courses on machine learning. I frequenly talk about Feature-engine and machine learning in general 
through blogs, talks and podcasts.

If [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) is useful for your **organization**, consider 
[sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/feature-engine). â˜•
