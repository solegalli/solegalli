# Hi! I'm Sole (Soledad Galli) 👋

Hey there! 👋 I'm Sole, a seasoned data scientist, published author, and machine learning 
instructor with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of data science. ✨

In my journey, which kicked off in 2015, I've lent my expertise to finance and insurance companies. Here, I 
crafted robust machine learning models to tackle insurance claim assessments, credit risk evaluations, and fraud.

In 2017, I pioneered my first online course, **Feature Engineering for Machine Learning**, recognizing a 
gap in resources at the time. Since then, I've expanded my course offerings, delving into diverse aspects of machine 
learning. We now host more than 7 courses on advanced machine learning topics, taught by me and other extraordinary instructors,
which you can find at our online school [**Train in Data**](https://www.trainindata.com).

Additionally, I've given life to the open-source Python library: [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine). 🚀

Currently, I'm pouring my energy into advancing [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) 
and creating new, impactful [**courses on machine learning**](https://www.trainindata.com).

You'll often find me sharing insights about Feature-engine and the broader machine learning landscape through blogs, 
talks, and podcasts. 

Excited to connect, collaborate, and learn together! 🌟"
