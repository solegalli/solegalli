# Hi! I'm Sole (Soledad Galli) ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sole, a seasoned data scientist, published author, and machine learning 
instructor with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of data science. âœ¨

In my journey that kicked off in 2015, I've lent my expertise to finance and insurance companies. Here, I 
honed my skills in crafting robust machine learning models, tackling challenges such as insurance claim 
assessments, credit risk evaluations, and fraud prevention.

In 2017, I pioneered my first online course, **'Feature Engineering for Machine Learning.'** Recognizing a 
gap in resources at the time, I've since expanded my course offerings, delving into diverse aspects of machine 
learning. Additionally, I've given life to an open-source Python gem: [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine). ðŸš€

Currently, I'm pouring my energy into advancing [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) 
and creating new, impactful [**courses on machine learning**](https://www.trainindata.com).

You'll often find me sharing insights about Feature-engine and the broader machine learning landscape through blogs, 
talks, and podcasts. 

If you discover that [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) brings value to your work 
or learning journey, consider [sponsoring my efforts](https://github.com/sponsors/feature-engine) or enrolling in
my [**courses**](https://www.trainindata.com). 

Your support goes a long way in fueling the growth of valuable resources and impactful courses for the community.

Excited to connect, collaborate, and learn together! ðŸŒŸ"
