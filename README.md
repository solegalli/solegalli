### Hi there, I'm Sole (Soledad Galli) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist, book author, machine learning instructor and open source developer. âœ¨

I am also the creator and maintainer of [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine). ðŸš€

I am passionate about learning and teaching topics related to data science, machine learning and AI software engineering in Python. 

If you want to learn more about machine learning, check my [online courses](https://www.trainindata.com/#courses) and my book: [Python Feature Engineering Cookbook]( https://packt.link/python)  âš¡

I'm currently dedicating a big chunk of my time to [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) and to creating new courses on machine learning. At the same time, I talk about Feature-engine and machine learning in general through blogs, talks and podcasts. 

If [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) is useful for your **organization**, consider sponsoring my work. â˜•
