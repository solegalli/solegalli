# Hi! I'm Sole (Soledad Galli) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lead data scientist, book author, machine learning instructor and open source developer. âœ¨

I started working as a data scientist in 2015. I've worked in finance and insurance companies, and then in an 
energy start-up. I created machine learning models to assess insurance claims, credit risk and prevent fraud.

In 2017, I created and launched my first online course: **Feature Engineering for Machine Learning**. I created 
this course because I saw a gap in the available resources on the topic at that time. Since then, I've created 
more courses on machine learning and also an open-source Python package for feature engineering: 
[**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine). ðŸš€

I am passionate about learning and teaching topics related to data science, machine learning and AI software 
engineering in Python. 

I'm currently dedicating to expanding [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) and to 
creating new courses on machine learning. I frequenly talk about Feature-engine and machine learning in general 
through blogs, talks and podcasts.

If [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine) is useful for your **organization**, consider 
[sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/feature-engine). â˜•

## Books

Find out more about machine learning. In my books I implement multiple feature engineering techniques with 
available Python libraries. You will have the code at your fingertips.

| Books | Summary |
|---|---|
| [**Python feature engineering Cookbook, second edition**](https://packt.link/0ewSo) |  Over 70 code recipes to implement feature engineering in tabular, transactional, time series and text data. |
| [**Feature selection in machine learning with Python**](https://leanpub.com/feature-selection-in-machine-learning/) |  Over 20 methods to select the most predictive features and build simpler, faster, and more reliable machine learning models. |
